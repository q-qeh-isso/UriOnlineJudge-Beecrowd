# Type of Fuel

A gas station wants to determine which of their products is the preference of their customers. Write a program to read the type of fuel supplied (coded as follows: 1. Alcohol 2. Gasoline 3. Diesel 4. End). If you enter an invalid code (outside the range of 1 to 4) a new code must be requested. The program will end when the inserted code is the number 4.

## Input

The input contains only integer and positive values.

## Output

It should be written the message: "MUITO OBRIGADO" and the amount of customers who fueled each fuel type, as an example.
