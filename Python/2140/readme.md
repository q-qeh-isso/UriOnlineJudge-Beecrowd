# Two Bills

---

Gilberto is a famous sfiha vendor. However, although everyone likes his sfihas, he can only give the change with two different bills, i.e., it's not always possible to get the right change. In order to make Gil's life easier, write a program for him to check whether it's possible to give the exact change using two different bills.

Available bills: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100.

## Input

The input contains an integer **N** representing the buy price and then an integer **M** representing the price paid by the costumer (**N** < **M** â‰¤ 104). Read input until **N** = **M** = 0.

## Output

Print "possible" if it's possible to give the exact change or "impossible" if it's not.
