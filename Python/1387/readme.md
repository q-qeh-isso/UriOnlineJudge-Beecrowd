# Og

---

Og is a caveman with many children, and he wants to count them all. 
Og counts his sons with his left hand and his daughters with his right hand.

However, Og is very dumb, and can't add the two counts, so he asked you to write him a program that will do the addition.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers **L** and **R**, separated by a single space, indicating respectively the number of sons and daughters (1 ≤ **L**, **R** ≤ 5).

The end of input is indicated by **L** = **R** = 0.

## Output

For each test case in the input print a line containing a single integer indicating how many children Og has.
