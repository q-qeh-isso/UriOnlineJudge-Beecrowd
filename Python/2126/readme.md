# Searching Subsequences

---

Given two natural numbers **N1** and **N2**, it is said that **N1** is contiguous subsequence of **N2** if in **N1** appear all digits in the same order and contiguously. Create an program
 that reads two natural numbers and write if the first is a contiguous subsequence of the second.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases and ends with the end of file (EOF). The first line of each entry is composed of anatural value **N1** (1 <**N1** <1010), the second line is composed of a value **N2** (**N1** <**N2**<1032).

## Output

For each test case print the amount of contiguous subsequences and the position where the substring starts, if there is more of a subsequence, print where it started the last substring. If no there subsequence, print "Nao existe subsequencia" (that means no there subsequence). Show the result as the sample output.
