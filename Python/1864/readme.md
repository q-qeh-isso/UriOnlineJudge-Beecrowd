# Our Days Are never Coming Back

---

So, have you <u>li</u>ked the Winter School this year? In order to make this School happen, many have worked, whether in writing the problems, in con<u>f</u>iguring th<u>e</u> Portal, <u>i</u>n making the arrengement<u>s</u> for the eve<u>n</u>t <u>o</u>r in raising <u>t</u>he funds. Our speci<u>a</u>l acknowledgement this year goes to <u>Pro</u>fessor Ricardo Oliveira, who has not only accepted our invitation to come and teach the workshops but has also <u>b</u>een participating on the organisation of this Schoo<u>l</u>. W<u>e</u> are sure that his experience and his career at ICPC as contestant and as coach have <u>m</u>o<u>t</u>ived and inspired us all.

We h<u>o</u>pe you have enjoyed these last days in Essos and in Westeros, we hope you have learned a lot and had fun. <u>B</u>ut it is not only in <u>Es</u>s<u>o</u>s and in Westeros that you shou<u>l</u>d ha<u>ve</u> fun. Here, in Beyon<u>d</u> the Wall, programming is also fun. Keep studying, keep training, and more and more. What is important is the path you choose to pursue from now on. Our advice is that you should always enjoy every single moment, every workshop, every school, every training session, every time practicing or studying at home. Our days are never coming back.
