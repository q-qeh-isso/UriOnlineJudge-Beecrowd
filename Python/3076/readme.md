# History Exercise

---

After a very good history class - suceeding a very poor math class - some students from a specific school are in doubt on a simple problem. The teacher asked them about the numeric value (for the sake of simplicity, it must be in decimal and should contain arabic algarisms) of the century of a given year but, as only few students got it, she 
decided to ask you to help creating a program that does exactly this for educational purposes.

For those who not remember this history class, the century 1, for example, means the years among 1 and 100, the century 2 the years among 101 and 200, the century 3 the years among 201 and 300 and so on.

## Input

The input contains several test cases and is finished by the end-of-file. Each line is a new test case and contains a single integer ***N*** (1 ≤ ***N*** ≤ 109), that means the value of some year that should be processed.

## Output

For each test case, output a line with the value of the century of the corresponding year.

| Input Sample                         | Output Sample                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1<br><br>999<br><br>2000<br><br>2001 | 1<br><br>10<br><br>20<br><br>21 |
