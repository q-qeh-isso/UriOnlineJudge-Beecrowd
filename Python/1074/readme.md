# Even or Odd

---

Read an integer value **N**. After, read these N values and print a message for each value saying if this value is *odd*, *even*, *positive* or *negative*. In case of zero (0), although the correct description would be "EVEN NULL", because by definition zero is even, your program must print only "NULL", without quotes.

## Input

The first line of input is an integer **N** (**N** < 10000), that indicates the total number of test cases. Each case is a integer number **X** (-107 < **X** <107)..

## Output

For each test case, print a corresponding message, according to the below example. All messages must be printed in uppercase letters and always will have one space **between** two words in the same line.
