# Indecision of Reindeers

---

This year Santa's Reindeers decided that Rudolph would no longer be the one who would always be ahead. They would choose, at a fair way, who would lead the sled. And nothing is fairer than chance.

Then they decidied the following way to choose: Each Reindeer would do as many snowballs as he wanted without the others seeing. Then all the snowballs of all the Reindeers would be gathered into a single large pile. Lastly, the snowballs would be drawn from this stack one by one, and distributed among them always following the order: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, and Rudolph. Until the snowballs were gone. The reindeer that got the last snowball would be 
declared the winner and would be in the main sled position this year.

Given the number of snowballs made by each Reindeer, determine which Reindeer won the draw.
