Given the initial position of a Knight on a chessboard and the target position, it must be said if, with exactly one movement, the Knight can reach the target position. If this is possible, the move is classified as valid, otherwise the move is said invalid..

## Input

The entry consists of a single line containing the initial position of the Knight and the target position, separated by a space. A position in the board is specified by a character, which represents the column, followed by an integer representing the line.

## Output

The output consists of a line containing the message "VALIDO" if the move is a valid movement of a Knight in the game of chess or "INVALIDO" otherwise.
