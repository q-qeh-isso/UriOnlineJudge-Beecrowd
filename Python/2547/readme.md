# Roller Coaster

---

Everyone in Nlogônia is really excited with the opening of Ricardo Barreiro World, the newest amusement park in the country. Its roller coaster, the fastest in the continent, is being widely advertised on TV and Radio. It’s the attraction everyone, from kids to grandmas, wants to ride.

Unfortunately, some restrictions were imposed by the government during the attraction’s homologation. For safety reasons, there is a minimum and a maximum height people must have to ride the roller coaster.

In the inauguration day, every guest filled a register in which they indicated their heights. In order to reduce lines and optimize the operation, you were hired to write a program that, given the number of guests, the minimum and maximum allowed height, and the height of every guest, determine how many guests are allowed to ride the roller coaster.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100), **Amin** and **Amax** (50 ≤ **Amin** ≤ **Amax** ≤ 250), the number of guests, the minimum and the maximum allowed height, respectively, in centimeters.

Each of the next **N** lines contains an integer (50 ≤ **Ai** ≤ 250), the height of the **i**-th guest, in centimeters.

The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the number of guests allowed to ride the roller coaster.
