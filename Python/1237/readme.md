# Compare Substring

---

Find the longest common substring between the two informed Strings. The substring can be any part of the String, including the entire String. If there is no common substring, return 0. The search is *case sensitive* ('x' != 'X').

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two lines that contains a string each. Both input Strings will contain between 1 and 50, inclusive, letters (a-z, A-Z), and/or spaces.

## Output

The length of the longest common substring between the two Strings.
