---

Write an program that reads two numbers X and Y (X < Y). After this, show a sequence of 1 to y, passing to the next line to each X numbers.

## Input

The input contains two integer numbers X (1 < X < 20) and Y (X < Y < 100000).

## Output

Each sequence must be printed in one line, with a blank space between each number, like the following example.

| Input Sample | Output Sample                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3 99         | 1 2 3<br><br>4 5 6<br><br>7 8 9<br><br>10 11 12<br><br>...<br><br>97 98 99 |
