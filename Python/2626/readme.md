Dodô, Leo e Pepper often spend the early hours of the morning chatting somewhere in the condominium Jardim Botânico IV. In the last few sessions, Dodo has been talking about the RPG game he and Leo are creating, and Leo (not surprisingly) has spoken about heavy metal and Pepper was fascinated by the story of Greek mythology told by Leo.

The boys decided to adopt a strategy to divide the sessions equally among the subjects, só each one to them can speculate as much as possible and arrive at unbilievable conclusions. They wall play “rock, paper and scissors” to decide the subject of today’s session, and then they will alternate the subjects in the next sessions. Given the moves of Dodo, Leo and Pepper, in this order, you must determine the subject 
of today’s session.

## Input

The input is composed of several test cases and ends with end of file (EOF). Each test case consists of a single line, which contains the plays of each of the boys, as shown in the exemples.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line with the message *"Os atributos dos monstros vao ser inteligencia, sabedoria…"* to indicate that Dodo is the winner, the message *"Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far!"* to indicate that Leo is the winner, the message *"Urano perdeu algo muito precioso…"* to indicate that Pepper is the winner, of the message *"Putz vei, o Leo ta demorando muito pra jogar…"* if there is a tie.
